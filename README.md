## Development:

- Make `.env` files ready:

```
cp ./.env.example ./.env
cp ./.env.docker.example ./.env.docker
```

- Start Docker containers:

```
pnpm docker:dev:up
```

- Manage database with Prisma:

```
# Generate Prisma client
pnpm prisma:generate

# Create/Apply migrations (dev)
pnpm prisma:migrate:dev

# Seed database
pnpm db:seed
```

### Better Auth🔒

Rolling our own auth is doable but maintaining all kinds of authentication types ourselves has been found out to be a challenging task. Moreover, rolling our own auth poses security risks. That's why this boilerplate uses [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) for everything related to authentication. All of the industry standard authentication kinds are ready to be used out of the box so that you focus on building features rather than worrying about auth shenanigans:

- Email/Password
- OAuth
- Magic Link
- Pass Keys
- Two Factor Authentication
- Role based Authentication & Authorization
- Session Management

You can find the frontend client setup [here](https://github.com/niraj-khatiwada/ultimate-nestjs-client). You can find your auth API documentation by visiting `/api/auth/reference`

### Automatic API Generation on the Frontend 🚀

You can automatically generate and use all of your backend API in frontend in just one command, thanks to Swagger and OpenAPI spec. Running `pnpm codegen` on the frontend (example [repo](https://github.com/niraj-khatiwada/ultimate-nestjs-client)) will automatically generate all API's bootstrapped with [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) ready to be used with just one import. See complete example [here](https://github.com/niraj-khatiwada/ultimate-nestjs-client)

### Server & Database Monitoring 🚨

Prometheus & Grafana are available with Docker setup only. You might only need to monitor your server or database when the user base grows or when you want to debug some specific issues. That's why this step is completely optional. If you want to monitor your server or database, just enable `monitoring` profile in your `.env` i.e. `COMPOSE_PROFILES=monitoring`.

### Docker 🐬

##### For local development:

- Start container:

```
pnpm docker:dev:up
```

- Stop container:

```
pnpm docker:dev:down
```

##### For prod build:

- Start container:

```
pnpm docker:prod:up
```

- Stop container:

```
pnpm docker:prod:down
```

Note: The docker scripts are Podman-compatible. The wrapper at `bin/compose.mjs` auto-detects `docker compose`, `podman compose`, or `podman-compose` and loads both `.env` and `.env.docker` so you can use Podman with Docker compatibility on your machine without changing commands.

The Docker image runs using PM2 and supports launching either the API or the Worker process via the `PM2_ONLY` env var (configured in `docker-compose.yml`).

```
# API only
docker run -e PM2_ONLY=nestjs-boilerplate your-image

# Worker only
docker run -e PM2_ONLY=technabit-backend-worker your-image
```

##### Deployment:

```
sh ./bin/deploy.sh
```

or run workflow `.github/workflows/main.yml` via GitHub Actions.

### Email Management 📬

#### React Email

Let's face it, it is not practical to just create some random html email templates and inject your variables and send it to your clients. Your email templates must be checked for spam, CSS compatibility for different email clients, accessibility, responsiveness, etc. You need to make sure all these checks are passed so that your emails don't end up in spam folder. [React Email](https://react.email/) is perfect fit for this. It uses React and provides many responsive email component blocks so that you can test all of the things mentioned earlier in your local development.

<b>NOTE</b>: We use React Email only in local development. We don't ship React and it's packages in production at all(<i>you can see that all of the React packages are dev only</i>). After our email templates have been created, we convert the `.tsx` files into static html files at build time and NodeMailer uses that html file from our backend. All of these things are handled automatically, you don't have to do any extra setup.

- React Email dev server: See all of your email templates in Web UI.

```
pnpm email:dev
```

- Build email templates(Handled): Convert `.tsx` templates file into html(`.hbs`). This is already handled in post build (`build` script).

```
pnpm email: build
```

- Watch Email(Handled): Watch your `.tsx` email files inside `templates/` folder and convert them to html(`.hbs`). This is already handled when you run your Nest.js server (in `start:dev` script).

```
pnpm email:watch
```

### MailPit SMTP Server

In local you can easily test your email by using [MailPit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) email client that ships with it's own SMTP server. The SMTP server will automatically run when you run your docker in development mode:

```
pnpm docker:dev:up
```

After that, just visit `http://localhost:<DOCKER_MAIL_CLIENT_PORT>`. You can find `DOCKER_MAIL_CLIENT_PORT` on `.env.docker`. By default, it will run on `http://localhost:18025`

### Dependency Graph 📈

Visualize all of your project modules and their dependencies. Also, detect circular dependencies.

NOTE: Make sure [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) is installed first.

- All dependencies:

```
pnpm graph:app
```

- Only circular dependencies:

```
pnpm graph:circular
```

### Database Entity Relationship Diagram🛢️

With Prisma, ERD generation is not built-in here. Options:

- Prisma Studio (data browser): `pnpm exec prisma studio`
- ERD generation (optional): add a Prisma ERD generator to your project, such as `prisma-erd-generator` or `prisma-dbml-generator`, and run it during `prisma generate`. Refer to each tool’s setup guide.

No ERD generator is wired by default to keep dependencies minimal.

### Running API and Worker

Run the API and Worker separately during development:

```
# API
pnpm start:api
pnpm start:api:dev

# Worker
pnpm start:worker
pnpm start:worker:dev
```

The default entry files are `src/main.ts` (API) and `src/worker.ts` (worker).

Shared logic lives under `src/core/*` and is wired via `CoreModule` and helper functions in `src/core/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts`.

### Prisma Logger ⚙️

Control Prisma query logging via env or config (defaults shown):

- `DATABASE_LOGGING`/`APP_LOGGING`: enable logs when set to `true` (default: `false`)
- `PRISMA_LOG_SLOW_MS`: warn threshold for slow queries in ms (default: `200`)
- `PRISMA_MAX_QUERY_LENGTH`: max SQL length in logs before truncation (default: `2000`)
- `PRISMA_REDACT_PARAMS`: hide bind parameters when `true` (default: `true`)

Additional Prisma service controls:

- `PRISMA_SKIP_CONNECT`: when `true`, skips initial `$connect()` (useful for unit tests) (default: `false`)
- `PRISMA_MAX_RETRIES`: max connection retry attempts on startup (default: `5`)
- `PRISMA_RETRY_DELAY_MS`: delay between connection retries in milliseconds (default: `1500`)
- `PRISMA_METRICS_ENABLED`: disable simple in-memory metrics when set to `false` (default: `true`)

These resolve into the `prisma` config (see `src/core/config/prisma/prisma.config.ts`) and are applied by `PrismaService`.
